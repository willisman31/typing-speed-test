# typing-speed-test

My own take on the typing speed test as a native application.

## How to Use

Download the package, unpack, and run from command line using below command:

```
java Run.java
```

## How to Change Wordlist

You can add words to the wordlist simply by adding new entries (one per line) to the wordlist.txt file; or by replacing the wordlist file completely.  In any case, each word should be on a different line and be located in a file with the name "wordlist.txt".
